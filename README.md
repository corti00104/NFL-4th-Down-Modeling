Leveraged 2021-2023 NFL play-by-play database and utilized Python for data scraping from PFF and Pro Football 
Reference, statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques. Implemented data pre-processing, feature 
selection, and cross-validation for predictive accuracy. 
• Developed models to estimate 4th down conversion probabilities, combining play-by-play data, team rankings, and 
situational variables. Created decision-making framework that considers various scenarios, conditions, and micro 
variables to deliver a verdict on whether a conversion attempt will be successful. 
• Leveraged logistic regression, feature importance selection, and random forests to predict binary outcomes, using 
football context to optimize model features, and understanding team dynamics, field conditions, and strategy.
